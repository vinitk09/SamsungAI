### Project Artefacts

- **Technical Documentation** - [Docs](docs) *(All technical details are written in markdown files inside the docs folder in the repo)*
- **Source Code** - [Source](src) *(All source code is added to the src folder in the repo.)*
- **Models Used** - *The project uses a pre-trained TensorFlow Lite model (model.tflite) for on-device anomaly detection. This open-weight model is deployed locally within the application.*
- **Models Published** - *This project focuses on implementing a multi-agent system for real-time analysis and does not involve developing or publishing new models.*
- **Datasets Used** - *The application does not use static, pre-existing datasets. It dynamically generates its own dataset in real-time by capturing user interaction data (typing biometrics, touch patterns, device movement) directly from device sensors and accessibility services. The dataset used for the initial training of the model.tflite is outside the project's scope.*
- **Datasets Published** - *The data collected by the application is for on-device user profiling and is stored locally. No datasets are published.*

### Attribution 

This project was developed from scratch as a novel multi-agent system for behavioral anomaly detection on Android devices. It is not built on top of an existing open-source project.
